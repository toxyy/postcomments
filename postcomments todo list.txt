NI = not important for dev topic/forum release
left to do for post comments:
	[ ] fix deleting posts
		[X] soft delete takes care of most use cases, users can see them and they reflect in viewtopic/viewforum postcount and pagination with the pull requests
		[X] need to remove whole tree for permanent option
		[X] mostly done and kinda working YEAH!
		[ ] find solution to array_flip(array_flip())
		[ ] fix parent's comment count
		[ ] fix thread's post count
		[ ] check notifications
		[ ] take a look to see if soft deleted posts count towards total board stats/forum stats
	[ ] fix moving posts
		[ ] move just the post or whole tree?
	[ ] add root (full too maybe?) & parent button next to conext
	[ ] do the whole acp
		[ ] add option for removing all user info from posts except username and pm button to make comments more compact
		[ ] add acp config for default sort direction per forum
		[ ] add config option for quick reply per forum
NI	[ ] take a look at the search page
NI	[ ] check post review list (when making a post), see if it needs any work. probably show only current depth, maybe parent post at top?
NI	[ ] make sure everything looks ok in modcp
NI	[ ] fix sorting once and for all for all current options
		[ ] topics
		[ ] modcp
		[ ] post review?
		[ ] search?
		[ ] SUPER BONUS: add sorting option/compatability for thanks for posts/post reactions/post love :)
	[ ] --- possibly move the monster sql query to a controller/helper
	[X] add quick reply

	[ ] add show more button
		[ ] no javascript solution
			[ ] need array in url params... such as postid,expandcount,postid,expandcount etc
		[ ] ajaxify it
NI	[ ] should quoting be on the same depth level as that comment?
NI	[ ] add @mention extension support for comments at max depth (from what i can tell this is just adding [mention]username[/mention] instead of quote
		[ ] should it be @mention support, or fake @mention? such as, @username (link to post with anchor?)? option in acp for making it postid instead?
NI	[ ] add route for closure table path, makes it cleaner in code
NI	[ ] take a look at notifications - yep, need to make it just like quote but link to context? in topic link if depth/rowcount is ok?
NI	[ ] should last post link REALLY be the last comment, or last post of depth n?
